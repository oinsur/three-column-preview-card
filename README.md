## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I learned how to arrange containers from one to three columns. 
I also learned how to work with svg images.
I was also able to get some more practice with hover effects on buttons. 

### Continued development

I would like to continue practicing how to work with hover effects.
Perhaps apply custom animations in future exercises/projects.

### Useful resources
